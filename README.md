# html5_projects_advanced_to_do_list

The HTML5 Projects series (Lynda.com) combines HTML5, CSS3, and recent JavaScript API technologies to enhance your web projects with interactivity and multimedia. This installment shows how to create a basic to-do list widget with an editable field so users can enter their tasks and delete them as they are completed, and a more advanced version with all the bells and whistles, including a drag-and-drop interface that allows for quick and easy sorting. Author Joseph Lowery covers HTML5 technologies such as web databases, content editing in the browser, and CSS transitions and transforms.
Topics include:
Making content editable
Saving edits
Setting up the core files for your app
Removing list items
Enabling drag-and-drop sorting

I had challenges with the final advanced To Do List (Saving and retrieving your list chapter 3-05).
